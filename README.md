# Face Recognizer
This project implements a real-time Face Recognition Attendance System using Python, OpenCV, and the face_recognition library. The system recognizes faces from a live webcam feed, matches them with a predefined database of images, and marks attendance by recording the name and timestamp in a CSV file.
